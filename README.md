##  Introduction
I am a certified nursing assistant working in a hospital setting for almost 3 years. Before I recieved my certification through an accelerated course, I worked Apple tech support. As much as I loved solving issues someone encountered with their device, I wanted a change and decided I would go in to healthcare. My interests, however, involved computers and tech. I love reading what updates are implemented in new software as well as configuring devices and making them customizable. My other interests include; baking, painting, and exploring ABQ. My aim is to work as a software developer for a startup or a company like Sandia Labs, truthfully, I'm not picky. I look forward to the experience I gain at any job I recieve.
